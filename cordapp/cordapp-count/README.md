# CorDapp Count

This CorDapp demonstrate non-spend Corda notarization feature that prevents double spend
Once the state record has been already used and can non longer been used for other transactions

Test scenario
* Start flow StartSender from PartyA - this will the start the counter to zero
* Still in PartyA start flow AddFlow with PartyB- this will increment the counter from previous state and notary will create a reference state from the previous record
* Repeat the previous command - this will fail indicating that is unable to notarize the transaction becuase its input records have been used before
* Query PartyB to verify the Count field
